# Archive - Development & Phase Documents

This folder contains documentation from earlier development phases that are now consolidated into the main documentation structure.

## Purpose

These documents were used to track feature development progress and phase completions. They are archived here for reference but superseded by:
- **docs/FUTURE_WORK.md** - Current roadmap and priorities
- **docs/INDEX.md** - Main documentation index
- **FEATURE_SUMMARY_DEC2025.md** - Current feature inventory
- **README.md** - Main project entry point

## Archived Documents

## How to Use

If you need to reference historical development context:
1. Check the specific document in this archive
2. For current information, use main documentation in `docs/`
3. For feature inventory, see `FEATURE_SUMMARY_DEC2025.md`

## Cleanup History

**December 11, 2025:**
- Consolidated 9 obsolete development phase documents
- Archived old QUICKSTART.md
- Archived old PROJECT_INDEX.md
- Removed duplicate/redundant documentation from root directory
- All active documentation now properly organized in `docs/` subdirectories

This maintains clean historical records while keeping the main repository lean and focused on current development.
